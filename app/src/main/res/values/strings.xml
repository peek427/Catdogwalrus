        Let’s talk about variables.If you have ever taken a math class you have probably seen variables of some kind. Equations, for example, are made up of variables, or letters that represent numbers you pick.$
        </string>
    <string name="lesson1_1_2">
        In programming you have variables just like this but instead of the variables only being used for numbers you can use them to represent almost anything!
    </string>

    <string name="lesson1_1_3">
        The most common variable types are:\n
    Int\n
    Double\n
    Char\n
    String\n
    Bool\n
    </string>

    <string name="lesson1_1_4">
        Int is used to represent an integer, which is a whole number.
    </string>

    <string name="lesson1_1_5">
        Double is used when you want to represent a decimal value.
    </string>

    <string name="lesson1_1_6">
        Char is used to represent a single character. This can be a letter or symbol from the keyboard. You use single quotes around the character to show it is a single character.
    </string>

    <string name="lesson1_1_7">
        Next we talk about string. String is how we show a series of characters that are connected. This is basically a strange way of saying a sentence. You can type inside of double quotes to indicate it is a string.
    </string>

    <string name="lesson1_1_8">
        Finally, the last major type we have is a bool. This is short for the word boolean. This type of value holds either true or false.
    </string>

    <string name="lesson1_1_9">
        Think you can match the data with the type of variable you need? Lets go!
